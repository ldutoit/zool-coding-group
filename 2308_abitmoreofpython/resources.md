[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is amazing, it contains dataset and enormous amount of coders and ressources
to learn about data science

[Scientific python](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) Some modules we did not cover contains loads of tools for python programming
among those, numpy and scipy as well as scikit might be the most important.
