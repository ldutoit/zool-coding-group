As expected, youtube is full of videos regarding python. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA) is from a man claiming to explain 90% of python programming in his 45mn video. And I think he really does in a very clever, smart and efficient way

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is amazing, it contains dataset and enormous amount of coders and ressources
to learn about data science

[Scientific python](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) Some modules we did not cover contains loads of tools for python programming
among those, numpy and scipy as well as scikit might be the most important.
