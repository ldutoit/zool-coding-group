## Ressources

Here are just a few ressources to help you further with python:

* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/index.html)

* [Python in 43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA) is from a man claiming to explain 90% of python programming in his 45mn video. And I think he really does it, in a clever, smart and efficient way.)

* [Argument parsing](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/python-command-line-arguments-argv-example/)

* Plots

  * [plots and code](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)

  * [plotting tutorial]( https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is amazing, it contains dataset and enormous amount of coders and ressources
to learn about data science

* [Scientific python](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) Some modules we did not cover contains loads of tools for python programming
among those, numpy and scipy as well as scikit might be the most important.
