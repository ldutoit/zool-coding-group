# Guidelines

## Summary

This document summarizes the 4 phases of our little project as well as the objectives.

## Objectives
 
 The main pobjective is that your project should be shareable. If it is a data visualisation script, it should be usable by someone else with similar data formats. If it is a video game, it should be playable by someone else, etc...
 To achieve this: 
 * you will share your poject as a github repository. You will also share example data if it is something that requires special data format or files.
 * you will document your code
 * you will try to write nice code as much as possible
    * write functions
    * avoid repetitions
    

## Four steps

### Timeline


This is a one month project.

in 1 weeks from 1 to 12 : Presnetation of pseudocode and idea
two weeks later: You should share the code with me, 
1 week later: Cake and presentation

###

### 1.Get an idea and write the pseudocode

Once you have an idea of a project, you will try to deconstruct your project into [pseudocode](). This is code written in plain english and just help you lay down the structure of your project. It could start by simply being big steps like:

```
# Read the sequence
# Output basic statistics
```

and slowly become something much more precise. The more precise it is, the more structured your ideas are andthe easier the coding will be!

```
#Read the data
## Ask user for input file
### create a sequence dictionnary that will store all my sequences
### Read file line by lin
  if  the line starts with ">":
    this a new sequence... store it
  else:
    add this line to the last sequence
### Calculate statistics
 for sequence in sequences:
        print gc content and length 
  

```

To help you do this, do it iteratively getting slowly more precise and keep questions in mind like:

* What will be the input and the output for your project?
* What should be the amin functions?
* What should be the main objects?


### 3. Transform it into code

Take your pseudo code and start filling in code. Use google a lot for the problems and also our slack project channel ( also use me!)

### 4.Present it to everyone
